Ruby Fundaments 2
==================
In my continued dive into familiarizing myself with the Ruby programming language.
This first part of this exercise we wrote code to convert farhenheit to celsius.
Next we learned to work with Arrays, finding an element within an array, printing this whole array,
sorting the array, and deleting an element from the array.
The final piece of this exercise, we worked with Hashes. The work is similar to that of the Arrays.
